def quicksort(ar:list):
    """
    Sort a list with quicksort algorithm.

    The quicksort algorithm splits a list into
    two parts and recursively sorts those parts
    by making swaps based on the elements value
    in relation to the pivot value.  It is an 
    O(n log(n)) sort.

    Args:
        ar: list to sort.

    Returns:
        The input list sorted.
